## Basic Overview
Moshiro is a basic anime platform/database, list or anything you want to call it. My final goal that I want to achieve is for this platform to be technologically better than Anilist.

## Running
- This part of README will be empty for now, Moshiro is still in development and tech-stack can change.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
